# GlacieR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of GlacieR is to provide a low tech implementation of data versioning. It does this by providing an interface layer to intermediate flat files which chooses the most recent version, provided it follows a fairly straightforward naming convention. To accelerate the process of saving files in this manner it also makes use of some file saving helpers.

This package leverages the excellent `{config}` package, and will have some inherited idiosyncracies on top of the many author introduced ones. 

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
